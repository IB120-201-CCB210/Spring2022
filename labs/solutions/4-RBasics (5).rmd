## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r print statements}
print("Hello World") # comments are made using the '#' sign, same as in Python
```

## Math Operators

```{r operators}
5+5
5-1
5*2
4/2
4^2
#or
4**2
```

There's also logical operators:

```{r logic}
4>2
2>4
2>=2 # greater than or equal to
2==2 # exactly equal
4!=2 # not equal to
```

## Variables

```{r variables}
x <- 2
y <- 3
z <- x + y
z
```

## Data Types

```{r doubles}
typeof(3) # notice this will still be a double

x <- 3.0 # R recognizes to drop the 0
x
typeof(x)
y <- 3.5
y
typeof(y)
y <- as.integer(y)
y # type casting y will truncate the original value
typeof(y)
```

Variables are not limited to storing numbers:

```{r other data types}

myName <- "Ksenia Arzumanova"
myName
is.character(myName) 
```
```{r vectors}
myList <- c(1,2,3) 
myList

anotherList <- c("a", "b", "c")
anotherList 

myList[2]
anotherList[2]
```

Note: Unlike Python, R starts indexing at `1`, instead of `0`.

## Data structures

### Matrices

```{r matrix}
A = matrix(c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) # filled by rows
A
B = matrix(c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE) # filled by columns
B
```

To extract a particular value, the syntax is `mat[row, col]`. You can leave both values blank, which will return all the values; leave one blank and it'll return all the values for that particular row or column.

```{r matrix cont}
B[,] # the whole matrix
B[2, ] # second row, all of the columns
B[ , 1] # all rows, first column
B[2, 1] # second row, first column
```

### Dataframes

```{r dataframes, paged.print=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(geneIndex = c(1, 2, 3), geneID = c(92231, 2313, 5641), geneName = c("FOS1", "JUN", "BERP"))
df
```

You can extract values from a dataframe similarly to how you would from a matrix.

```{r dataframes cont}
df[1, 2]
```

Or, you can use the field names by using the `$` symbol.

```{r fields}
df$geneID # all of the rows that belong to geneID
df$geneID[2] # second row under geneID
```

Here's some examples of matching values, though there's other ways we can do this:

```{r matching}
which(df$geneID == 2313) # returns the row for which the condition returns 'true'
df$geneName[df$geneID == 2313]
```

```{r data}
data()
```

```{r cars}
class(cars) # here I don't use 'typeof()', because there's a hierarchy between that and 'class()' - 'typeof()' returns the data types of the elements of the object, in this case they would be of type 'list'. If we used 'class()' on doubles, it would return type 'numeric', because integers and doubles belong to the class 'numeric'

str(cars) # displays the internal structure of the object
nrow(cars) # number of rows
ncol(cars) # number of columns
head(cars, n=5) # first 5 rows
tail(cars, n=5) # last 5 rows
dimnames(cars) # names of the dimensions - first element will return a list of rownames, second will be a list of column/field names
summary(cars) # returns summary statistics, such as min, max, mean, and quartile information
```

## Plotting

(Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r mtcars}
dimnames(mtcars)[2] # field names
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg) # defaults to scatter plot
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, type = 'b') # tries to connect lines between points (not always meaningful)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, type = 'h') # histogram-like lines
```

`ggplot2` is another great package that allows for a lot of plotting versatility that we'll be using later on.

## Probability Distributions

### Background
#### Random Variables
Informally, a random variable is a variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random event. The domain of a random variable is called the *sample space*, or the set of possible outcomes of event (such as heads or tails in a coin toss). Random variables have *probability distributions* associated with its sample space. Random variables can be discrete (finite or countable set of values), the probability distribution of which can be described by a probability mass function (PMF), or continuous (all values in an interval), the probability distribution of which can be described by a probability density function (PDF).

#### Probability Distributions
A probability distribution is a function which gives the probability of occurrence of an event confined within
one experiment. The most famous and widely used probability distribution is the normal (or Gaussian)
distribution. The central limit theorem states that the sum of independent random variables will resemble
a normal distribution as the number of samples increases. For example, the distribution of students' heights
at UC Berkeley resembles a bell curve, which is the normal distribution. A cumulative distribution function (CDF) shows the probability that a random variable will take a value less than or equal to x, which in the graphs below have units of standard deviations. Recall that standard deviations are a measure of the amount of variation in the data.

```{r rnorm}
#draw random variates from the normal distribution
variates <- rnorm(10)
variates
```

```{r dnorm}
#calculate probabilities (densities) of variates
dnorm(variates)
plot(variates, dnorm(variates))
```

Brief refresher on critical values:

```{r pnorm}
#cumulative density to the left of the variate

pnorm(0) # should be intuitive, because half of the normal distribution is to the left of 0 
pnorm(1.96) # 1.96 should look familiar as one of the critical values for an approximate 95% confidence interval 
pnorm(-1.96) # however these critical values are for a two-tailed test (for a significance level of 5%)
pnorm(1.96)-pnorm(-1.96)

```

`pnorm` and `qnorm` are opposites:

```{r qnorm}
#gives us the exact points at which the normal distribution has a particular cumulative density

qnorm(0.5)
qnorm(0.975)
qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975))
```

```{r tree height, echo = FALSE}
hist(trees$Height, main = "Histogram of Black Cherry Tree Heights", freq = FALSE, 
     xlab = "Tree Height") # setting `freq = FALSE` transforms the y-axis to density rather than frequency
```

The above histogram looks approximately normal. We can visually compare this by drawing random variates from a normal distribution. 

```{r normal distribution}
x <- rnorm(1000) 
y <- dnorm(x) 
hist(x, freq = FALSE, ylim = c(0,0.4)) 
plot(x,y) # alternative representation
```

Our axes are off, however, between the histogram of tree height and the normal distribution curves. We can remedy this by changing our `mean` and `sd` to better represent that of the tree height distribution.

```{r comparing tree heigh and normal distribution}
x <- rnorm(1000, mean = mean(trees$Height), sd = sd(trees$Height))
y <- dnorm(x, mean = mean(trees$Height), sd = sd(trees$Height))
hist(trees$Height, freq = FALSE)
points(x, y)
```

## Assignment

1. Draw 100 random samples from the normal distribution with a mean of 50, and standard deviation of 5. Plot the histogram of these samples.

```{r q1}
#set.seed(100)
x_assignment <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 5)
y_assignment <- dnorm(x_assignment, mean = 50, sd = 5)

hist(x_assignment, main = "Histogram of a Normal Distribution", freq = FALSE, 
     xlab = "X", ylim = c(0,0.1)) # setting `freq = FALSE` transforms the y-axis to density rather than frequency
points(x_assignment,y_assignment)


```

2. Show that 50% of the density is to the left of the mean above.

```{r q2}
# hist(norm, main = "Histogram of a Normal Distribution", freq = FALSE, 
#      xlab = "Counts",labels = TRUE, ylim=c(0,.1)) # setting `freq = FALSE` transforms the y-axis to density rather than frequency


histPercent <- function(x, ...) {
   H <- hist(x, plot = FALSE)
   H$density <- with(H, 100 * density* diff(breaks)[1])
   labs <- paste(round(H$density), "%", sep="")
   plot(H, freq = FALSE, labels = labs, ylim=c(0, 1.08*max(H$density)),...)
}

histPercent(x_assignment,main = "Histogram of a Normal Distribution", col="gray")





#Answer 2
pnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = 5)
```

3. Repeat part 1, but with standard deviations of 10, and then 100. Describe, in comments within the script, how the spread of the data (or domain/range) change with standard deviation. 

```{r q3}
#SD 10
x_3 <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)
y_3 <- dnorm(x_3, mean = 50, sd = 10)

hist(x_3, main = "Histogram of a Normal Distribution", freq = FALSE, 
     xlab = "X", ylim = c(0,0.06))
points(x_3,y_3)
#The spread of the data becomes slightly wider than in part 1.


#SD 100
x_4 <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 100)
y_4 <- dnorm(x_4, mean = 50, sd = 100)

hist(x_4, main = "Histogram of a Normal Distribution", freq = FALSE, 
     xlab = "X", ylim = c(0,0.02))
points(x_4,y_4)
#The spread of the data becomes much wider than in part 1.


```

4. Now draw again 100 random samples from the normal distribution with a mean of 50, and standard deviation of 5. Calculate the densities/probabilities of these random samples. 

```{r q4}

```

5. Plot the samples and densities calculated in part 4. This should look similar to the first figure in the Background section.

```{r q5}

```

6. Calculate the *cumulative* densities of the same 100 samples from part 4. Plot the samples and their cumulative densities. This should look similar to the second figure in the Background section. What does the far-most right point mean? 

```{r q6}
x_assignment <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 5)
y_assignment_2 <- pnorm(x_assignment, mean = 50, sd = 5) #Instead of using dnorm like above, you can switch to pnorm
plot(x_assignment,y_assignment_2)
#CDF: The far most right point is the likelihood that a value is less than or equal to X. The sloped tail to the left of this value is the decreasing possibility of values being selected as you move away from x. 


```

7. Under your plot function from part 6, type in the following code: \begin{equation*} abline(h=0.5, v=50)  \end{equation*} 
This should have created grid lines on your plot. In trying to understand the relationship between PDFs and CDFs, how does the point in the graph outlined by the gridlines correspond to your answer in part 3. Answer in comments.

```{r q7}
x_assignment <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 5)
y_assignment_2 <- pnorm(x_assignment, mean = 50, sd = 5) #Instead of using dnorm like above, you can switch to pnorm
plot(x_assignment,y_assignment_2)
abline(h=0.5, v=50)
#The larger the standard deviation, the more spread that points will have across the x axis. The mean will remain the same, at 50, but the x axis will vary in length as a function of standard deviation. 
```
